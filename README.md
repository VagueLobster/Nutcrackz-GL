# Nutcrackz (OpenGL)
This is my engine heavily based on the TheCherno's [Hazel2D](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/).

And i have also borrowed some stuff from [Peter1745](https://github.com/peter1745), [ToniPlays](https://github.com/ToniPlays) and [Toastmastern87](https://github.com/Toastmastern87)!

My Undo/Redo system i got from this YT video by [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqRHjhaECv4)!

I've also gotten some help from my friend [abbator](https://github.com/abbator)!

This engine won't be very actively developed on anymore, but I may still make some changes now and then.
